# Auto Mode with April Tags

## How it works?
As implemented in the FTC template, it works as follows, 
- The robot uses a camera to locate and approach an AprilTag.
- It has manual and automatic modes, where the manual mode allows joystick control and the automatic mode drives the robot towards the tag.
- The driving mechanism involves adjusting speed, strafe, and turn using predefined gains and the detected tag's positional data.
- The file includes initialization for camera settings and AprilTag detection, and it provides telemetry data for driver feedback.
