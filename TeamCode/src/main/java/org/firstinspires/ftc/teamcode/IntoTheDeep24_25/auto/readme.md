# Into the Deep 24-25 Autonomous

## April Tags
Capital Robotic will use April Tags for autonomous navigation. The tags will be placed on the field and the robot will use the tags to navigate the field.
We will use a combination of algorithms for movement including PID.


## TO DO
- [ ] Create a class for the robot to use the April Tags, and read April Tags
- [ ] Create a `JanxsMovment` class with easily reusable method to control movements in autonomous we can use this class to create custom movements for the robot depending on what we need
- [ ] Create a `JanxsPID` class to control the robot's movement using PID
- [ ] Create a `JanxsAuto` class to control the robot's autonomous movements
